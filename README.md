# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Project 03 : Investigate a Dataset

## Introduction
In this report, we are going to explore a dataset taken from TMDB's database which contains information of more than 10,000 movies dating from 1960 up to 2015. More specifically, by applying data wrangling, analyzing and visualizing techniques learnt from Udacity to raw data in the tmdb-movies.csv file, we will be able to answer the following questions:

- Which movie genres tend to generate the most ( and the least ) average revenue in each decade, starting from 1960 to 2015 ?

- Which production companies have the largest total revenue from 1960 to 2015 ?

- Does it cost more to make a movie in 2015 than in the 1960s, 1970s or even 2000s, with inflation being taken into consideration ?

- What are the most profitable movies being made during each decade, starting from 1960 to 2015 ?

- Who are the most successful actors / actresses measured by having the largest total revenue for the movies that they starred in ?
